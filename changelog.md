# Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2025-08-14
### Fixed
- LunaLib settings are now reliably applied on game load and at runtime
- Removed reflection-based reads (blocked in scripts); use direct LunaLib API
- Ensured plugin is the single source of truth; runtime script reads from plugin only
- Absolute guard prevents supply generation when disabled

### Technical
- Build script compiles against LunaLib JAR (auto-detected path)
- Minimal, useful logging; removed noisy per-frame and file-based debug output
- Cleaned stray compiled classes and leftover files from repo

### Notes
- `settings.json` serves as a baseline only when LunaLib isnâ€™t ready; LunaLib overrides once available
