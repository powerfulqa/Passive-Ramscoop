# Development Guide for Passive-Ramscoop

This document describes how to build and contribute to Passive Ramscoop, plus developer notes about the runtime architecture and common pitfalls.

## Requirements
- JDK 11 or later installed (JDK 17 recommended). NOTE: the build scripts compile with `--release 8` so the produced bytecode is compatible with Java 8 (required by Starsector). Using JDK 11+ is recommended for development tooling, but the build intentionally targets Java 8 compatibility.
- PowerShell to run `build.ps1` (Windows) or PowerShell Core on other platforms
- Starsector 0.98a-RC8 installation for local compilation against the game jars (optional if you use the committed `jars/Ramscoop.jar` in CI)
- LunaLib installed in your local Starsector `mods/` folder if you want to compile against LunaLib API locally

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository and open it in your IDE of choice.
2. Ensure `JAVA_HOME` points to a JDK installation.
3. Build the mod:

```powershell
pwsh .\build.ps1
```

The output JAR is placed in `jars/Ramscoop.jar`.

## Project layout (short)
- `src/ramscoop/` — Java sources (`ModPlugin.java`, `Ramscoop.java`) 
- `data/config/LunaSettings.csv` — LunaLib UI configuration
- `settings.json` — legacy fallback config
- `Ramscoop.version`, `mod_info.json`, `version.json` — release/version metadata
- `.github/scripts/check-versions.ps1` — version consistency checker used by CI

## Architecture overview
- `ModPlugin.java` — mod entry point and settings orchestration
  - Loads settings with priority: LunaLib (if available) → `settings.json` → hardcoded defaults
  - Exposes public static fields consumed by runtime logic
- `Ramscoop.java` — runtime `EveryFrameScript` implementation
  - `advance(float amount)` called frequently; expensive work is throttled with an `IntervalUtil`
  - Applies fuel / supplies to the player fleet via dynamic stats modifications

## Key developer notes & pitfalls
- LunaLib CSV percent signs: LunaLib renders CSV tooltips with `String.format()`; escape literal percent signs as `%%` in `LunaSettings.csv`.
- CSV keys must exactly match the code's `LunaSettings.get*(MOD_ID, "fieldID")` calls (case-sensitive).
- Use `DEBUG_MODE` guarded logging; leave `DEBUG_MODE = false` for release builds.
- The code attempts to read new LunaLib Color values first (the `_v2` keys). Legacy string hex values are no longer exposed in the CSV UI to avoid menu clutter.

## Build / compile notes
- The `build.ps1` script attempts to discover a Starsector install and LunaLib jars; if not found it will still compile but you may miss LunaLib API access locally. CI relies on a committed `jars/Ramscoop.jar`, so the CI job does not require a local Starsector installation.
- If you need to compile against a Starsector core locally, set `SS_DIR` at the top of `build.ps1` or install Starsector into a standard path.

Note on PowerShell compatibility
- The `build.ps1` script is compatible with both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`). Older versions of PowerShell may lack some modern cmdlets (for example `Join-String`), so the script prefers cross-version constructs where possible. If you run into odd errors in PowerShell 5.1, try the script with `pwsh` or update your PowerShell to a newer release.

## Versioning & release automation (important)
We added an automated consistency check and release helper to avoid TriOS failures caused by mismatched version metadata.

- `.github/scripts/check-versions.ps1` compares the versions in `mod_info.json`, `version.json`, and `Ramscoop.version` and exits non-zero if they differ.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the check on PRs and pushes and will fail the job if versions are inconsistent.
- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) extracts the release tag (e.g., `v0.7.2` → `0.7.2`), runs the checker in `-Fix` mode to update those three files to the tag version, and commits/pushes the updated files back to `main` so packaging uses the correct metadata.

Notes and caveats:
- The `-Fix` mode rewrites `Ramscoop.version` as JSON and will remove any comment lines. If you rely on comments in that file, suggest leaving them out or ask for a conservative in-place patcher (we can add one).
- If you prefer the release workflow to create a PR instead of committing to `main` directly, we can change that behavior.

## How to run the version checker locally
- Check only:

```powershell
pwsh .github/scripts/check-versions.ps1
```

- Auto-fix locally (this will rewrite files):

```powershell
pwsh .github/scripts/check-versions.ps1 -Fix -Version 0.7.2
```

After running `-Fix`, review the changed files and commit them.

## Testing checklist (developer)
- Build with `pwsh .\build.ps1` and confirm `jars/Ramscoop.jar` exists
- Run the game with LunaLib enabled and open the settings to ensure all entries show correctly
- Verify runtime behavior by entering a nebula/corona and observing fuel/supplies generation
- Run `pwsh .github/scripts/check-versions.ps1` to ensure version metadata is consistent before tagging a release

## Release process (maintainer)
1. Tag the release with `git tag vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and push the tag
2. The release workflow will run, auto-fix version files to the tag (if necessary), commit them, and package the release assets
3. Verify the created GitHub release and that `Ramscoop-<tag>.zip` contains the expected files
4. TriOS and other automated updaters will read `Ramscoop.version` and `mod_info.json` to detect the new release

## Contributing
- Fork, create a branch, make changes, open a PR
- Ensure `pwsh .github/scripts/check-versions.ps1` passes on your branch before requesting review
- Keep runtime `DEBUG_MODE` off for PRs unless debugging a specific issue
