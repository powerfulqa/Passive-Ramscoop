## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-27 (Corona Time)
### Added
- Corona fuel generation with independent caps (soft/hard/margin) and per-tab rate.
- Nebula tab now includes supplies controls; Corona tab is fuel-only.
- Robust corona detection with terrain-plugin checks and star-distance fallback.

### Changed
- Removed Global Fuel Caps and the use-global toggles; each tab controls its own caps.
- Simplified UI into tabs: General, Nebula, Corona.

### Fixed
- Cases where corona detection failed are now covered by fallback; added a one-line diagnostic when corona fuel runs.
- Corona fuel caps were not applied in some cases due to caps not being loaded; loading fixed and caps now respected.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-27
### Added
- LunaLib tabs: General, Fuel, Supplies.
- Fuel controls: soft cap (0â€“100%), hard cap, margin; rate now a percent slider.
- Global "Scoop Enabled" toggle (runtime) affecting fuel and supplies.

### Changed
- Defaults: Fuel rate 4%, fuel soft cap 20%, hard cap 0, margin 0. Supplies limit default 0.20.
- Clamp fuel addition to cap minus margin to prevent 0.1 overfill.

### Fixed
- Supplies now respect the global Scoop toggle.
- LunaLib settings seed from legacy settings.json when missing, then apply immediately.
