# Changelog 

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-13
### Added
- Per-event notification toggles (nebula entry/exit, corona entry/exit) exposed via LunaLib so players can independently enable or disable floating-text notifications for each event.
### Changed
- Reworked Notification UI: grouped Nebula and Corona notification settings and removed legacy color preset radios in favor of LunaLib HSV color pickers.
- Default notification colors changed to light gray (#D3D3D3).

## [0.6.3] - 2025-10-09
### Fixed
- Fixed crash when opening LunaLib settings menu (percent signs in descriptions are now properly escaped as %%)
- Eliminated excessive debug logging that was bloating log files (174+ entries per session reduced to 0)

### Changed
- Improved all LunaSettings descriptions with detailed explanations and practical examples for better user experience
- Code cleanup: Added descriptive constants for all default values (improved maintainability)
- All debug logging now controlled by DEBUG_MODE flag (set to false for production builds)

### Technical
- Added DEBUG_MODE flag to both ModPlugin and Ramscoop classes
- Conditionalized 7 debug logging statements
- No functionality changes to fuel/supply generation mechanics
- 100% backward compatible with existing saves and configurations

## [0.6.2] - 2025-10-09
### Fixed
- Fixed key mismatch: nebula_percent_supply_limit -> ramscoop_percent_supply_limit
- Fixed key mismatch: nebula_hard_supply_limit -> ramscoop_hard_supply_limit
- Added null-handling for supply limit settings to prevent NullPointerException
- Added ramscoop_supply_per_crew key (code expected this but CSV only had nebula_supply_per_crew)
- Added corona_caps_reuse boolean setting for corona fuel cap reuse control
- Kept nebula_supply_per_crew as legacy key for backward compatibility
- Completes fix for 'Value not found in JSONObject' errors
- Updated version to 0.6.2 across mod_info.json, version.json, and CHANGELOG.md"

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-28
### Fixed

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-27 (Corona Time)
### Added
- Corona fuel generation with independent caps (soft/hard/margin) and per-tab rate.
- Nebula tab now includes supplies controls; Corona tab is fuel-only.
- Robust corona detection with terrain-plugin checks and star-distance fallback.

### Changed
- Removed Global Fuel Caps and the use-global toggles; each tab controls its own caps.
- Simplified UI into tabs: General, Nebula, Corona.

### Fixed
- Cases where corona detection failed are now covered by fallback; added a one-line diagnostic when corona fuel runs.
- Corona fuel caps were not applied in some cases due to caps not being loaded; loading fixed and caps now respected.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-27
### Added
- LunaLib tabs: General, Fuel, Supplies.
- Fuel controls: soft cap (0â€“100%), hard cap, margin; rate now a percent slider.
- Global "Scoop Enabled" toggle (runtime) affecting fuel and supplies.

### Changed
- Defaults: Fuel rate 4%, fuel soft cap 20%, hard cap 0, margin 0. Supplies limit default 0.20.
- Clamp fuel addition to cap minus margin to prevent 0.1 overfill.

### Fixed
- Supplies now respect the global Scoop toggle.
- LunaLib settings seed from legacy settings.json when missing, then apply immediately.

## [0.4.1] - 2024-12-19
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: LunaLib settings are now properly applied when the game loads
- **Settings Loading Issue**: Fixed timing problem where LunaLib settings were accessed before LunaLib was fully initialized
