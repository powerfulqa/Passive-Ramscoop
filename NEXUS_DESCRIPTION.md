## Long Description

### What This Mod Does
Ever wished your fleet could collect fuel and supplies whilst travelling through nebulae and near stars? The Passive Ramscoop mod makes this dream a reality! Your ships will automatically gather resources as you explore, reducing the need for constant supply runs and making exploration more rewarding.

**Balanced Design Philosophy**: The idea around balancing this mod was that it's used to make sure you can always get some fuel if you are very low by entering a nebula or star corona. By default, it only fills the fuel tank to 20% - enough to get you out of trouble, but not enough to replace normal fuel management. Everything is fully configurable though, so you can adjust the rates to match your preferred difficulty level.

### Key Features
